# MODULES

## 9. Importing the core modules

---

- Node comes with some inbuilt modules
- Some are available globally and some need to be imported
- Modules like `console` are available globally and we can use functions like `console.log` like a native function
- some modules like `fs` need to be imported to use

## 10. Importing Your Own Files

---

- Every file is a module in js
- we have to provide path to import the file in `require()` function.
- Every Module has its own scope ( variables and functions belong to one module cannot be used by another module until explicitly exported ).
